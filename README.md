# Team-Builder #

  ## Description ##
  My motivation to make this project was to be able to easily generate a team roster through the VS Code terminal. I built this project so I can have a well structured and easy to read team roster with contact and other basic information about the team members including managers, engineers and interns. Now with this project completed, it gives me all the basic information about my work team on one page, so I don't have to look in multiple places for it all. I learned throughout this project how to create and run tests on my JavaScript coding.

  ## Installation ##
  The steps required to install this project are as listed: 1) NPM install required packages. 2) npm test to run the test files. 3) node index.js to initiate prompt for team roster builder. 

  ## Usage ##
  To use this project one must fill out the series of prompts through the terminal once you have already npm installed all required packages, npm test the test.js files to make sure the coding is in working order, and input node index.js to start the prompt. After including all employees and their basic contact information, an index.html file will be created with all of the input information. Their email addresses will link themselves to an empty email message with the contactee's to field already filled in, and/or their GitHub username will open up their GitHub profile if they are an engineer. It will also all be displayed clearly and in an appealing design once opened in the file explorer.
